# Summary of *On Writing Well*: Chapter 1-3

## Chapter 1: Transaction
Writing is not easy, words seldom flow. It requires hard work and frequent practices to be a good writer. Professional writers rewrite their sentences over and over. To become better, you must know how to keep the readers alive. The ultimate product that any writer has to sell is not the subject being written about, but who he or she is. To get there, writers need to use the language in a way that will achieve the greatest clarity and strength but not use gimmicks to "personalize" the writer.

## Chapter 2: Simplicity
Avoid clutter. A clear sentence is no accident. The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Words servers no function, long word that could be a shorter one, an adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb - these parts weaken the strength of a sentence. To achieve freedom from clutter, we need to clear our heads of clutter. Clear thinking becomes clear writing. Good writing doesn't come naturally. Writers must constantly ask: what am I trying to say? Thinking clearly is a conscious act that writers must force themselves.

## Chapter 3: Clutter
This chapter continued the discussion on clutter and ways to prevent it. Writing improves in direct ratio to the number of things we can keep out of it that shouldn't be there. Zinsser showed examples of political speech. Every writer should look for the clutter in their writing and prune it ruthlessly. Be grateful for everything you can throw away.
