# Summary of *On Writing Well*: Chapter 4-7

## Chapter 4: Style
The fundamental rule is: be yourself. It requires writes to do 2 things together - relax and have confidence - which is nearly impossible. Try to write in first person if possible: to use "I", "me", "we" and "us". If not allowed, at least think "I" while writing. Sell yourself and your subject will exert its own appeal. Writing is an act of ego, use its energy to keep yourself going.

## Chapter 5: The Audience
"Who am I writing for?" The fundamental answer is you are writing for yourself. Never say anything in writing that you wouldn't comfortably say in conversation.
The author makes a complicated point in this chapter, it first looks strange but ultimately together makes sense to me:
1. Don't try to visualize (worry about) the great mass of the audience, every reader is a different person. 
2. However, you must work hard on your craftmanship - the basics of writing. It's a mechanical act to make your sentence grounded and in solid principle. You don't want to lose the reader through sloppy workmanship. 
3. Use the skill you practiced in point 2 to express your personality. Relax and say what you want to say and be true to yourself.  

To sum up, if the reader dozes off because you have been careless about technical detail, the fault is yours. But don't worry about things like whether the reader likes you or what you are saying or how you are saying it. Don't give that a moment's worry. 

## Chapter 6: Words
You'll never make your mark as a writer unless you develop a respect for words and a curiosity about their shades of meaning that is almost obsessive. Use a dictionary, and use a dictionary of synonyms. Learn to use words with originality and care. 

## Chapter 7: Usage
The author continued his discussion on words by emphasizing on the importance of understanding word usage. Having an incorrect usage of words can make the readers confused and not attentive or alive to your writing. We should know the difference between allusion and reference and many more. Good usage equals to good choice of words.
