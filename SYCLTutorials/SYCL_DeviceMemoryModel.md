# SYCL Device Memory Model

In this tutorial, we will talk about basic concepts first on device memory. After that we will introduce more
concepts and their corresponding representation in SYCL.

## Global Dimension
A global dimension is a 1D/2D/3D parrellism defined for each kernel execution.
A work-item (thread) is execute in every point in the global dimension.

Let's take a few example:
1. Processing

2. 

3. 


## Local Dimension
