I am a passionate software developer with good knowledge on compiler, programming language and overall how computer works.
I consider myself a reasonably experienced (C++) developer with a particular interest in building efficient tools to connect technology
and users. I hold a master degree from University of Toronto and a bachelor
degree from Peking University in computer science.

I spent the last 3 years (2016 - 2019) building a heterogenous compiler specifically targeting FPGA which is now part
of [Intel OneAPI](https://software.intel.com/oneAPI). The scope of my work covers developing compiler optimizations in LLVM,
designing drivers handling complicated compiler toolchains [[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lBcyJ9TxfY&t)] and coordinating
the effort to build [code samples for oneAPI](https://github.com/intel/BaseKit-code-samples).
Recently, I switched to a new team building
[EDA tool for FPGA](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/overview.html)
to explore the underlying performance challenge for FPGA.

This is my technical blog which I started in March 2020. 

My current interests include: compile technology, heterogeneous computing, deep learning acceleration and software development practices.
